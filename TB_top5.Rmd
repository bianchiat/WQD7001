## Significance/Motivation
- Usually caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* bacteria that generally affects the lungs.
- TB patient suffer from coughing, it also ejected the TB germ. The germ can travel airborne and only several (of the germ) can infect a healthy person nearby, hence making TB a very contagious disease. 
- Tuberculosis ranked as the 2nd leading infectious causes of deaths, and one of the most burden-inflicting disease in the world. 
- In 2017, 10 million patient fell ill, with 1.6 million patient died from the disease.
- One of the most serious concern of TB is the raise of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and even the more severe extensive drug-resistance TB (XDR-TB) due the inappropriate and incorrect TB prescription. 


## Data Info

The data of tuberculosis were obtained from:

- [Source-Data Repository for WHO Tuberculosis](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.1315?lang=en).
- [Boston University â€“ Rutgers University Tuberculosis Research Unit (BU-RU TBRU)](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/tbru/).
- [Mayo Clinic Tuberculosis](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/tbru/).
- [WHO Tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis).
- [Wikipedia Tuberculosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis).
